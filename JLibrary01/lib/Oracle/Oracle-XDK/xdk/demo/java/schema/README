This directory contains some sample XML applications to show how to use the 
Oracle XML parser with XMLSchema processor.

The following are the sample Java files in this directory:

        XSDSample - A sample driver to process XML instance documents.
        XSDSetSchema - A sample driver to process XML instance documents 
                       by overriding the schemaLocation.
        XSDLax - Same as XSDSetSchema but use Lax validation mode
	DTD2Schema -  A sample driver to convert DTD to XML Schema

To run the sample program:

1) Use "make" to generate .class files.
2) Add xmlparserv2.jar, xschema.jar and the current directory to the CLASSPATH.

3) Run the sample program with *.xml files: 

	java XSDSample report.xml
        java XSDSetSchema report.xsd report.xml
        java XSDLax embeded_xsql.xsd embeded_xsql.xml

   Schema processor uses XMLSchema specification from "report.xsd" to 
   validate the contents of "report.xml"
     
	java XSDSample catalogue.xml
        java XSDSetSchema cat.xsd catalogue.xml

   Schema processor uses XMLSchema specification from "cat.xsd" 
   to validate the contents of "catalogue.xml"

	java XSDSample catalogue_e.xml
	java XSDSample report_e.xml

   Examples with XMLSchema errors. Schema processor generates error messages.

	java DTD2Schema dtd2schema.dtd dtd2schema.xml

   Example for converting DTD to Schema.  This example converts a dtd (argument 1) 
   into a schema and uses it to validate an xml file (argument2).
