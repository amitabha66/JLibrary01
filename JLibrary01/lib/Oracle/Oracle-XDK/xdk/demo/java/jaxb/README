This directory contains a sample Java file to show how to use the 
XML JAXB Class Generator.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

To run the demo, it is required to set the ORACLE_HOME and JAVA_HOME 
environment variables. 

If XDK is not installed in ORACLE_HOME, then set the ORACLE_HOME
to installation root. 

The following is the list of files and directories

Makefile - Makefile used to compile and run the demo in Unix
Make.bat - Makefile used to compile and run the demo in WINDOWS

The list of Samples:

1. Sample1: This sample demonstrates the binding of top level elements 
   and top level complexType's. 

2. Sample2: This sample demonstrates the binding of a top level element
   with an inline simpleType definition.

3. Sample3: This sample demonstrates the binding of a top level complexType 
   element which is derived by extension from another top level complexType 
   definition.

4. Sample4: This sample demonstrates the binding of content model within a 
   complexType which refers to a top level named group.

5. Sample5: This sample demonstrates the binding of 'choice' with maxOccurs 
   unbounded within a complexType

6. Sample6: This sample demonstrates the binding of atomic datatypes.

7. Sample7: This sample demonstrates the binding a complex type definition 
   which is of 'mixed' type.

8. Sample8: This sample demonstrates the binding of elements and types that
   are declared in two different namespaces.
