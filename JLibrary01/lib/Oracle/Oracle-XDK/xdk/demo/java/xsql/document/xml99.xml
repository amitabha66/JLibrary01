	 <Title>Abstract</Title> 
	 <Para>The potent combination of XML for portable Internet data exchange,
	 Java for portable application logic, and Enterprise relational databases for
	 mission-critical data management is the technology platform of choice for the
	 Internet Applications running the world's e-Businesses. This paper discusses
	 how relational databases and XML fit together and describes Oracle's approach
	 to providing this technology "stack" to developers.</Para>

	 <Title>How XML and Relational Databases Fit Together</Title> 
	 <Para>Relational databases offer two fundamental ways to handle XML-based
	 information, depending on whether the information is business data or document
	 content:</Para><SubSect1> 
	 <Title>XML Data and Documents in Relational Databases</Title><List Type="BULLET"><ListItem> 
	 <Para><Emphasis Type="Italic">Business Data</Emphasis> needs to be stored,
	 queried, analyzed, and manipulated efficiently by many different kinds of
	 applications.</Para> 
	 <Para>This kind of information is optimally stored <Emphasis Type="Italic">internally</Emphasis> in one or more relational
	 tables.</Para></ListItem><ListItem> 
	 <Para><Emphasis Type="Italic">Document Content</Emphasis>, both text and
	 multimedia, needs to searched in specialized ways specific to their media types
	 and efficiently assembled to produce dynamic documents.</Para> 
	 <Para>This kind of information is optimally stored <Emphasis Type="Italic">internally</Emphasis> in searchable content "chunks" that can
	 range in size from a single paragraph or frame of video, to entire documents or
	 videos.</Para></ListItem></List> 
	 <Para>When new XML-based messages or documents are stored in the database,
	 they are easily stored in their optimal <Emphasis Type="Italic">internal</Emphasis> form. Existing and future
	 <Emphasis Type="Italic">internal</Emphasis> applications can work with the
	 information in the most efficient way possible. When information must "leave"
	 the database, for sharing with partners or other applications, the appropriate
	 view of data and document content specific to the task at hand can be delivered
	 as an integrated XML document.</Para>
