    <para>This section documents "late-breaking" information you
    should know about Business Components for Java which is not
    covered in the documentation. Please refer to the Online

    <para><emphasis>Programmatically Removing a ViewLink Without
    Removing Linked ViewObjects </emphasis></para>

    <para>Creating a dynamic link between two ViewObjects
    programmatically works properly. However, if you dynamically
    remove the ViewLink you've created and then relink the same two
    ViewObjects that were previously linked, you will get an
    ORA-01006: Not All Variables Bound upon rexecuting a query on the
    master ViewObject. The workaround for this release is to not only
    remove the ViewLink, but remove and recreate the two ViewObjects
    before trying to dynamically relink them
    again.</para></listitem><listitem>

    <para><emphasis>Dynamically Setting VO Where Clause to Contain
    Different Number of Bind Variables</emphasis></para>

    <para>If you use the <literal>setWhereClause</literal> method on a
    ViewObject or RowSet to change the text of your query's WHERE
    clause, you need to pay attention to the situtation in which you
    set the new WHERE clause to contain a different number of bind
    variables (represented by question marks in your WHERE clause
    string) than the WHERE clause in use previously on the same
    object.</para>

    <para>To make sure that the array of bind variable parameter
    <emphasis>values</emphasis> is properly setup after such a WHERE
    clause change either:</para>

    <para><literal>setWhereClauseParams(Object[])</literal> to reset
    the entire bind variable value array, or</para>

    <para><literal>setWhereClauseParams(null)</literal> followed by
    <literal>setWhereClauseParams(int,Object) </literal>for the ones
    you want to set for the new WHERE clause's different number of
    bind variables.</para></listitem></itemizedlist></sect2>
