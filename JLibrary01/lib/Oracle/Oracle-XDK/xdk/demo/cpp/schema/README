This directory contains a sample XML Schema application to show how to use
the Oracle XML Schema Processor via its API.

This directory contains:

    Make.bat            Batch file for building sample programs

    xsdtest.cpp         Trivial program which invokes the Schema API

    car.{xsd,xml,std}   Sample Schema, instance document, and expected
                        output after running xsdtest on them.

    aq.{xsd,xml,std}    Second sample Schema

    pub.{xsd,xml,std}   Third sample Schema

A batch file, Make.bat, is provided to build and run the sample, just type
"Make".  Note that the executables are placed in ..\bin but should be run
from the sample directory (where the input data files can be found).

An error message file is provided in the mesg subdirectory.  Currently, the
only message file is in English although message files for other languages
may be supplied in future releases.  You should set the environment variable 
ORA_XML_MESG to point to the absolute path of the mesg subdirectory.
Alternately, if you have an $ORACLE_HOME installed, you may copy the contents
of the mesg subdirectory to the $ORACLE_HOME\xdk\mesg directory.

In addition, the environment variable ORA_NLS10 must be set to point to the
location of the NLS data files.  By default, this is usually
$ORACLE_HOME/nls/data.  Starting with version 10.1.0.0.0, C and C++ XDK
releases that are downloaded from OTN contain an nls/data subdirectory.  You
must set the environment variable ORA_NLS10 to the absolute path of the
nls/data subdirectory if you don't have an Oracle installation.

The following program will be built:

    xsdtest <document> [schema]
                        A sample application using the Schema API.  Given an
                        instance and optionally a Schema, loads the instance
                        and Schema validates.
