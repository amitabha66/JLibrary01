This directory contains some sample XML applications to show how to use the 
Oracle XDK C interfaces.

	                        output after running xsdtest on them
    schema/aq.{xsd,xml,std}     Second sample Schema
    schema/pub.{xsd,xml,std}   	Third sample Schema

    xslt/XSLSample.c		Source for XSLSample program
    xslt/XSLSample.std		Expected output from XSLSample
    xslt/XSLXPathSample.c	Source for XVMXPathSample program
    xslt/XSLXPathSample.std	Expected output from XVMXpathSample
    xslt/class.xml           	XML file that may be used with XSLSample
    xslt/iden.xsl            	Stylesheet that may be used with XSLSample

    xsltvm/XVMSample.c		Source for XVMSample program
    xsltvm/XVMSample.std	Expected output from XVMSample
    xsltvm/XVMXPathSample.c	Source for XVMXPathSample program
    xsltvm/XVMXPathSample.std	Expected output from XVMXpathSample
    xsltvm/class.xml           	XML file that may be used with XSLSample
    xsltvm/iden.xsl            	Stylesheet that may be used with XSLSample

A batch file, Make.bat, is provided in each of the subdirectories to build the
samples and to run them, comparing the actual output to the expected output.  
Type "Make" in any of the subdirectories to build executables for all samples.
You can also create a specific sample program by giving its name as a 
parameter, e.g. "Make DOMSample".

Note that the executables are placed in ..\..\..\bin but should be run from the
sample directory (where the input data files can be found).

An error message file is provided in the mesg subdirectory.  Currently, the
only message file is in English although message files for other languages
may be supplied in future releases.  You should set the environment variable 
ORA_XML_MESG to point to the absolute path of the mesg subdirectory.
Alternately, if you have an $ORACLE_HOME installed, you may copy the contents
of the mesg subdirectory to the $ORACLE_HOME\xdk\mesg directory.

In addition, the environment variable ORA_NLS10 must be set to point to the 
location of the NLS data files.  This is usually $ORACLE_HOME/nls/data.
Starting with version 9.0.1, C and C++ XDK releases that are downloaded from 
OTN contain an nls/data/ subdirectory.  You must set the environment variable 
ORA_NLS10 to the absolute path of the nls/data/ subdirectory if you don't have
an Oracle installation.

The following programs will be built:

    SAXSample [word]	A sample application using SAX APIs.  Given a word,
			shows all lines in the play Cleopatra containing that
			word.  If no word is specified, 'death' is used.

    DOMSample		A sample application using DOM APIs (shows an
			outline of Cleopatra, i.e. the XML elements ACT
			and SCENE).

    SAXNamespace	A sample application using Namespace extensions to
			SAX API; prints out all elements and attributes of
			NSExample.xml along with full namespace information.

    DOMNamespace	Same as SAXNamespace except using DOM interface.

    FullDOM		Sample usage of full DOM interface.  Exercises all
			the calls, but does nothing too exciting.

    xsdtest <document> [schema]
                        A sample application using the Schema API.  Given an
                        instance and optionally a Schema, loads the instance
                        and validates against the Schema.

    XSLSample <xmlfile> <xsl ss>
			Sample usage of XSL processor. It takes two 
                        filenames as input, the XML file and the XSL 
                        stylesheet.

    XVMSample <xmlfile> <xslfile>
			Sample usage of XSLT Virtuale Machine & Compiler. 
                        It takes two filenames as input - the XML file and 
                        the XSL stylesheet.

    XSLXPathSample <xmlfile> <xpathexpr>
			Sample usage of XSL/XPath processor. 
                        It takes an XML file and XPath expression as input.
                        Generates the result of evaluated XPath expression.

    XVMXPathSample <xmlfile> <xpathexpr>
			Sample usage of XSLT Virtuale Machine & Compiler.
                        It takes an XML file and XPath expression as input.
                        Generates the result of evaluated XPath expression.
